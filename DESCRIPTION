Description: Design parameters of the optimal two-period multiarm platform design
    (controlling for either family-wise error rate or pair-wise error rate) can be calculated
    using this package, allowing pre-planned deferred arms to be added during the trial. More
    details about the design method can be found in the paper: Pan, H., Yuan, X. and Ye, J.
    (2022) "An optimal two-period multiarm platform design with new experimental arms added
    during the trial". Manuscript submitted for publication. For additional references: Dunnett,
